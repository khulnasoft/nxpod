# ws-sync runs as daemonset on each node which renders telepresence useless for debugging.
# This script builds ws-sync locally, puts it in a Dockerfile, builds the image, pushes it,
# patches the daemonset and restarts all pods.
#
# This way you can test out your changes with a 30 sec turnaround.
#
# BEWARE: the properly built version of ws-sync may behave differently.
