Nxpod is an open-source Kubernetes application providing fully-baked, collaborative development environments in your browser - powered by VS Code. 

Tightly integrated with GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket, Nxpod automatically and continuously prebuilds dev environments for all your branches. As a result team members can instantly start coding with fresh, ephemeral and fully-compiled dev environments - no matter if you are building a new feature, want to fix a bug or do a code review.
