# Installer

> Please consult the [readme](./pkg/config/) when making changes to the configuration.

The best way to get started with Nxpod is by using our recommended & default installation method [described in our documentation](https://www.nxpod.khulnasoft.com/docs/self-hosted/latest/installing-nxpod). In fact, our default installation method actually wraps this installer into a UI that helps you manage, update and configure Nxpod in a streamlined way.

> The installer is an internal tool and as such not expected to be used by those external to Nxpod. Instructions for how to use it can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/khulnasoft/nxpod/tree/main/install/installer/docs/overview.md) folder of this repo.
